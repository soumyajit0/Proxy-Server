This project presents a robust and efficient Proxy Server built in C, integrating key concepts from Operating Systems (OS), Computer Networks (CN), and Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). The Proxy Server acts as an intermediary between clients and servers, facilitating secure and optimized data transmission.
